# Assignment
### Logic:
1. we have N number of questions and list of rules.
2. So, first we create a map, whose keys are questions and value is also a map of choice (any C1, C2, C3 or C4) and next question.
3. after that we start a while loop and while loop is executed till we reach end
4. in each iteration, we take input from the user about its choice (C1, C2, C3 or C4) and get the next question out of map using current question and choice.

### Time complexity
O(N*4)

### Space complexity
O(N)
